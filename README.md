## Overview
This program is a social communication platform that allows users to connect with friends by searching up for usernames. It also provides excellent privacy control by allowing its users to restrict or block others and deactivate their accounts if desired.
## Features
- Friends search and add: Search for friends via usernames and add them to your friend list.
- Privacy controls: Block or restrict other users, delete messages or accounts if desired.
- Secure profiles: User authentification with password validation and optional profile pictures.
- Photo messaging: Send and receive photos from friends to capture the moment.
